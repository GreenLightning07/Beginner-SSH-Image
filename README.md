Welcome to the Beginner Linux Training Image!!!

This Linux machine is known to be vulnerable and we need you to fix it.

Our policy is that only members of the leadership team are 
allowed on this machine.

No gaming or hacking software is allowed on this machine as well.

Secure Shell (SSH) is a open-source tool for users to remotely connect to 
other machines via the command line. It is the ONLY critical service that is allowed and it needs
to be secured.

All users are to have a secure password, and password complexity must be 
enforced. It has been already set that the users will be forced to make a password once they 
login.

We need to add Mr. Morale to the machine. Add a new user called Morale.

We also want to add a super secret linux group on the machine. Create a group called theboys and add Anshul, Casey, Jack, Andrew, and Brendan to it.

Do not alter cyber's ability to auto login and do not alter anything with 
the scoring machine

Remember to take notes, make backups in case you break something, and have fun

Please direct all questions to the short ginger in the lab AKA Casey Nazelrod.

In this README the format for users is username:password
